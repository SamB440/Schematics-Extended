Schematics Extended allows you to paste schematics block-by-block. It also allows fetching the palette and materials of a schematic before even pasting it.

You can find the documentation on the Spigot thread: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/previewing-and-pasting-schematics-block-by-block.324817/
